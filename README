INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a PHP class to hopefully make writing PHP applications to consume
"The Energy Detective" (TED) API a little easier.

More information on The Energy Detective available at:
  http://www.theenergydetective.com

GitHub: http://github.com/wgbartley/TED_PHP
Home Page: http://www.garrettbartley.com/TED_PHP/


REQUIREMENTS
------------
PHP 5.x
PHP SimpleXML Extension (http://www.php.net/simplexml)
PHP cURL Extension (http://www.php.net/curl)


INSTALL
-------
Extract the PHP source wherever and include it in your
scripts.


USAGE
-----
See TED_PHP.exec.php for an example usage.  Typical usage would be to instantiate
the TED_PHP class.  Once instantiated, set the API using set_api() function and
then using fetch() to return the data in an array.

$ted = new TED_PHP($TED_HOSTNAME, $TED_PORT, $TED_USERNAME, $TED_PASSWORD, $TED_SSL);

$ted->set_api('livedata');
print_r($ted->fetch());

$ted->set_api('secondhistory');
print_r($ted->fetch(1,1));
