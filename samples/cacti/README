INTRODUCTION
------------
Monitor your Energy Detective readings from Cacti

GitHub: http://github.com/wgbartley/TED_PHP
Home Page: http://www.garrettbartley.com/TED_PHP/


REQUIREMENTS
------------
PHP 5.x
TED_PHP
Cacti


INSTALL
-------
Extract to a directory accessible to your Cacti installation.  Edit config.php
to overwrite any variables from TED_PHP.config.php for your gateway device.

In Cacti, add a new Data Input Method named "The Energy Detective".  Select
"Script/Command" as the Input Type and type "php /path/to/cacti.php" as the
Input String where "/path/to/cacti.php" is the full path to cacti.php for
TED_PHP.  Next, add 3 output fields with field and friendly name of for each of
"cost", "voltage", and "power".  Save the Data Input Method.  Import the 4 XML
files included (Cacti_DataTemplate.xml, Cacti_GraphTemplate_Cost.xml,
Cacti_GraphTemplate_Power.xml, and Cacti_GraphTemplate_Voltage.xml).  Set up
your Energy Detective device and add the Cost, Voltage, and Power graphs to
the device.

In theory, that should get you up and running.  However, Cacti is by no means a
simple system.  It took me several attempts to get it setup and working for my
configuration, so there may have been some settings tweaked that may make it
incompatible for you.
