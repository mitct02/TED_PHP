INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a set of scripts to periodically poll a TED gateway device and insert
new records into a MySQL database.  The current two histories supported are
seconds and minutes as most everything else can be calculated from there.  Upon
first run, the script will attempt to get as much data in the past as it can.
On each subsequent run, it will attempt to calculate how much data it needs to
get based on the time offset between the MySQL server and the TED gateway
device.  It then adds a fudge factor specified in the mysql-insert.config.php
(currently set to an extra 50%).

REQUIREMENTS
------------
PHP 5.x
TED_PHP


INSTALL
-------
Create a MySQL database to house the data and run the create_tables.sql script
within that database.  Feel free to change the table names as you would like.
If you change the table names, you will need to update the $TED_TABLE_*
variables in mysql-insert.config.php.  Also set the appropriate MySQL connection
and authentication parameters in mysql-insert.config.php.  Finally, set up the
script(s) to run as a cron job.  For seconds data, once a minute is good.  For
minute data, once every 5 minutes is good.
